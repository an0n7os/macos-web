# Mac OS Monterey Web

This open source project aims to replicate some of the Mac OS(Moneterey, at the time)'s desktop experience on web, using standard web technologies like HTML, CSS and JS

ðŸ”—ðŸ”— [https://macos1.vercel.app/]

# Why

I've always been very fascinated with macOS, and have never owned a Mac/book. So I'm making the most beautiful aspect of macOS, it's desktop, myself. For web. Inspired from [WinXP](https://winxp.now.sh/).

# Stack

- Framework - Preact (Earlier React. Swapped for runtime performance gains)
- Bundler - Vite, for super fast development.
- Component Library - None!!
- Styling Solution - SCSS and CSS Modules.

# When will it be ready?
